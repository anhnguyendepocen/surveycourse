# Survey Mode #

## Outline ##

  - Activity
    - Discuss your proposals in small groups
    - What constructs are you trying to measure? How do you propose to do it?
    - What's the status of your questionnaire?

  - Mode
    - Definition: How the survey responses are collected
    - Recruitment mode and interview mode might differ
    - Not necessarily related to sampling frame
      - E.g., telephone sampling frame might be used to schedule in-person interviews
      - E.g., postal invitation might offer multiple modes
    
  - Modes
    - Personal interviewing
      - "Show cards"
      - Physical data collection (e.g., saliva swabs, blood)
      - Environmental measurement (e.g., water quality, radon levels)
    - Computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI)
    - Self-interviewing/Self-administered
    - Computer-assisted self-interviewing (CASI)
      - Web-based self-interviewing
    - Telephone interviewing
      - Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
      - Telephone-Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interviewing (T-ACASI)
    - New modes
      - Avatars
      - Web-based IVR
      - Mobile
      - SMS
    - Mixed modes
      - Multi-stage interview
      - Nonresponse follow-ups in different mode
      - Sensitive questions
      - Open-ended questions
      - Challenging topics
      - Paradata
      - Journals/logs
  
  - Mode consequences
    - Data quality
      - Recency/primacy
      - Unit and item nonresponse
      - Biases
      - Satisficing
    - Mode preferences
      - Individuals differ in how they want to complete surveys
      - This introduces systematic variability into responses
        - E.g., if those preferring internet differ from those preferring telephone
        - Mode-induced biases might be tied to self-selection into modes
    - Cost
      - Activity
    
  
  - Interviewers and modes
    - What do interviewers add to a survey?
      - Data quality
      - Response rates
      - Comfort
      - 
    - What consequences do they have?
      - Data quality
      - Discomfort/sensitivity
      - Cost money
      - Require training
      - Must be physically present
  
  - Cost/benefit calculations
    - What is the cost of an interview?
    - How many contacts to obtain a response?
    - Physical materials costs?
    - Travel costs?
  
  - Preview of next week (two weeks from now)
    - Final week of questionnaire design
      - Focus on survey mode
      - Budget
      - Comparison of modes for recruitment and response
    - Assignment
      - Discuss mode alternatives
      - Discuss their impact on cost and data quality
