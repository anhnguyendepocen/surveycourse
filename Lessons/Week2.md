# Who is being surveyed? #

## Outline ##

 - Review of last week
   - Paul Lazarsfeld
   - Causal Inference
      - Relationship
      - Temporal precedence
      - Nonconfounding
      - Mechanism
      - Level of analysis
   - Uses of surveys
     - From research questions to designs:
       - Description/prevalence
       - Changes
       - Effects
 - Activity I
   - Discuss research question ideas
     - Small groups
     - Share a couple of ideas
 - New Material
   - Total Survey Error
     - The perfect survey is a perfect census of a population where everyone answers all questions, each of which is measured perfectly
     - Errors can occur in any part of survey design, implementation, and analysis
     - Previous approaches to survey work focused on minimizing one kind of error
       - E.g., finding the best way to reduce sampling error
       - E.g., trying to minimize errors respondents make in understanding and answer questions
     - Total survey error is about trade-offs between different sources of error and trying to minimize them all within specific time and budget constraints
       - E.g., we can spend a lot of time trying to increase our response rate, but the cost of doing so might not matter if we don't have money to properly process data
       - E.g., we can design an incredibly complex strategy of recruiting respondents, but the challenge of implementing it may not be worth the cost in terms of the overall reduction in survey error
   - Populations
     - In research, this is rarely explicit
       - Residents population of a country
       - Citizens of a country
       - Voting age population of a country or actual voters
       - Adults
       - All human beings
       - All human beings in similar political systems
       - Other examples
         - Government employees
         - All countries, states, regions, cities
         - All political candidates for office this year, all time, everywhere
     - Census
       - National census
         - In Denmark: 1769 (approximately every 5-20 years after, give or take)
           - Ended in 1970 (Registry started in 1968)
         - Largest in world: India; 2011 implementation used to create a population registry
         - United States began in 1790; implemented every 10 years
       - Census in other populations
         - Population Registry or complete listing of some kind
           - Individual residents
           - Membership lists
           - Registered corporations
           - Publicly traded firms on stock exchanges
         - Commercial records
           - Every transaction between a business and a customer
           - Every patient to have visited a hospital
         - "Big data"
           - Every public post on Twitter
           - In U.S., every campaign contribution to any candidate or election committee over $50
       - Nice features
         - Perfectly representative (assuming correct implementation and no loss of data)
         - Sample statistics are population parameters
       - Problems
         - Costs (India 2011: $370 billion; U.S. 2010: $13 billion)
         - Feasibility
           - May not be able to enumerate everyone
           - Impractical
         - Need
           - If we have the population, there's a strong possibility we don't need to collect new data
           - Often little added value of a census over a large, population-representative sample
     - Representative sample
       - How do we define representativeness?
         - Face similarity (only applies to measured dimensions)
         - Same properties as sample: mean, variance, covariance structure, etc.
       - Quota sampling
       - Random sampling guarantees, in expectation, a representative sample
       - This does not guarantee that a sample statistic matches a population parameter in any given sample
       - Indeed, we cannot know the accuracy of any particular sample statistic w/o already knowing the population parameter
     - Activity II (not implemented this time)
       - Simple random sampling
       - Everyone takes a sample in the form of a bag of candy and estimates a statistic
       - Discuss sampling error (due to sampling variance)
       - Compare to larger sample size
       - Coverage errors:
         - Overcoverage error: a different kind of candy
         - Undercoverage error: Fotex doesn't sell a random sample of this particular kind of candy
     - Convenience samples
       - Passive/Opt-in samples (online, advertisements, MTurk, etc.) (unknown biases)
       - True samples of convenience: students, friends, etc. (known biases)
       - Valuable if "representative"
       - YouGov sample matching method
       - Randomly sampled individuals recruited into a panel
   - Purposive sampling
     - This is almost always misleading
     - If we want to know what, e.g., "pregnant women between 20-30" think, we need a sampling frame; the individuals we recruit through "purposive" sampling are not guaranteed to be representative
   - Sampling Frames
     - Definition: Enumeration of all units eligible for sample selection
       - All units in the frame have a non-zero probability of selection into our sample
       - All other units have a zero probability of selection into our sample
     - Process
       - Enumeration then random sampling
       - Systematic sampling of a randomized enumeration
     - Sometimes have to create sampling frame from scratch ("canvassing"/"enumeration")
     - In practice
       - Frames are rarely perfect (Coverage error)
         - Undercoverage (missing population units)
           - Sample of internet users
         - Ineligible units or overcoverage (units in frame not in population)
           - Summer homes
           - Non-citizens
       - Decisions
         - What is a household?
           - Homeless
           - Hotels
           - Nontraditional housing
         - Who is a resident of a household?
           - e.g., if your boyfriend/girlfriend stays with you some of the time, are they eligible to complete a study of your household?
         - At what point in time is someone in the frame?
           - e.g., Censuses often talk about residence at a specific date, even if data are collected at another time
       - Clustering
         - Multiple population units in a household
           - Sample all individuals
           - Randomly sample w/in household (individuals in large households underrepresented)
         - Multiple students in a given classroom (the BA methods course activity)
         - Multiple crimes that occurred simultaneously (if crime is the unit of analysis)
       - Repeated listing of units in the frame
         - Telephone numbers: household and mobile numbers
         - Email addresses: work, school, and personal numbers
       - List maintenance
         - Registry is a nice example: probably relatively clean
         - Voter registration lists in the United States
         - Customer and member lists
           - Units are deceased or no longer in the population
           - Valid unit but not contactable
       - Updating during data collection
       - Multi-frame
         - "Dual frame" (HH telephones and mobile telephones)
         - Online and telephone
         - Complicated because it requires figuring out the proportion of units in both frames (overlap)
           - E.g. from book
             - list of farms in a geographic area and list of farmers from a government agency or trade group
             - significant overlap between frames but there may still be undercoverage and overcoverage
   - Random/representative sampling w/o a Sampling Frame
     - Systematic sampling of a complete but unenumerated population
       - Heaney and Rojas rally example
       - Random walk
     - Sampling from a stream of units (has to assume order is random and all units are from same distribution)
       - Customers in a store
       - Products coming off an assembly line at a factory
       - E.g., "Every third person"
     - Random sampling of times/events
       - Animal behavior research: observe animals all day, record at random sample of time points
       - Study of water quality: random samples of days/times
     - Small, rare, or "hidden" populations: snowball sampling, respondent-driven sampling, etc.
       - Big concern w/ one kind of coverage error: overcoverage!
       - Problems w/ snowball sampling
         - All individuals are drawn from connections (direct or indirect) to an initial pool
         - Biased toward cooperative subjects
         - "masking": selection is made by other respondents who may have incentives to refer or not refer a participant
         - Sampling from networks biased toward individuals with large networks and individuals who are central in networks
       - Key-informant sampling
         - Do not have access to a representative sample of the hidden population
       - Targeted sampling
         - Basically trying to construct a sampling frame
       - Respondent-driven sampling
         - Differences from snowball sampling
           - Incentives: primary (participation) and secondary (recruitment of others)
           - Snowball-sampled individuals participate in an opt-in fashion (investigators do not know about them unless they participate)
         - Procedure
           - Select "seed" respondents
           - Seeds recruit secondary wave of participants
           - New participants offered the same incentive structure
           - Remove duplicates
           - Targeting of specific subpopulations
         - Who is Heckathorn trying to sample? What happens in that sampling process?
   - Activity III
     - Develop a sampling frame for a population and research question (prevalence, changes, effects)
     - Or, develop an alternative sampling scheme that does not require a full sampling frame
   - Simple Random Sampling
     - Finite population correction
     - Benefits:
       - Simplicity of implementation (conditional on having a sampling frame)
       - Simple analysis: sampling weights for each units is $\frac{1}{Pr(selection)}$
       - Survey estimates are just count, mean, proportion, etc. w/ simple variance/SE calculations
     - Downsides:
       - May not be possible if population cannot be enumerated
       - May be expensive (possible to significantly reduce costs w/ a clustered or stratified design)
         - E.g., HH survey in Afghanistan: incredibly difficult to randomly sample individuals (even if we had a sampling frame for them)
   - Sample size estimation
     - Mean
       - $v(\bar{y}) = (1-f)\frac{s^2}{n}$, where $f$ is proportion of population sampled
     - Proportion
       - $v(p) = (1-f)\frac{p(1-p)}{n-1}$, where $f$ is proportion of population sampled
     - Margin of error
       - $Estimate +/- 2 * SE$
     - Example
       - What will voter turnout be?
       - Which party or coalition will win the election?
       - Math:
         - $Var(p) = (1-f)\frac{p(1-p)}{n-1}$
         - $Var(p) = \frac{p(1-p)}{n-1}$
         - Solve for $n$
         - $n = \frac{p(1-p)}{v(p)} = \frac{p(1-p)}{SE^2}$
         - Guess value of $p$
         - $n = \frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{SE^2} = \frac{0.25}{SE^2} $
         - Pick intended value of $SE$
         - $n = \frac{0.25}{0.01^2} = \frac{0.25}{0.0001} = 2500$
         - If $SE=0.025$, $n = \frac{0.25}{0.000625} = 400$
         - If $SE=0.0025$, $n = \frac{0.25}{0.00000625} = 40,000$
         - Given an intended margin of error, the largest sample you will need is for a close proportion
         - Small samples are possible if the population proportion is closer to 0 or 1
         - If $p=0.9$, $n = \frac{0.9(1-0.9)}{0.01^2} = \frac{0.09}{0.0001} = 900$
         - In smaller populations (e.g., political candidates, mayors, school teachers, small town), we need to account for the finite population correction
           - With smaller population, we are calculating something closer to a census, so variances are even smaller with a given sample size
     - This is the kind of data analysis you almost always do in practice
       - We need to use different formulae for standard errors in more complex designs
       - Most data are not collected via simple random random samples (except some telephone surveys)
       - Most research ignores sample design and just analyzes everything as if it is a random sample
