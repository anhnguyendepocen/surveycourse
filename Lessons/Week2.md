# Who is being surveyed? #

## Outline ##

 - Review of last week
   - Paul Lazarsfeld
   - Causal Inference
      - Relationship
      - Temporal precedence
      - Nonconfounding
      - Mechanism
      - Level of analysis
   - Uses of surveys
     - From research questions to designs
 - Activities
   - Discuss research question ideas
     - Small groups
     - Share a couple of ideas
   - Develop a sampling frame for a population and research question (prevalence, changes, effects)
   - SRS activity
   - 
 - New Material
   - Total Survey Error
   - Populations
     - Census
     - Representative sample
     - Convenience samples
       - Valuable if "representative"
       - What does representative mean?
       - YouGov sample matching method
   - Sampling Frames
     - Enumeration then random sampling
     - Systematic sampling of a randomized enumeration
   - Sampling w/o a Sampling Frame
     - Systematic sampling procedures
     - Heaney and Rojas rally example
     - Sampling from a stream of units (has to assume order is random and all units are from same distribution)
   - Simple Random Sampling
     - Finite population correction
     - Benefits:
       - Simplicity of implementation (conditional on having a sampling frame)
       - Simple analysis: sampling weights for each units is $\frac{1}{Pr(selection)}$
       - Survey estimates are just count, mean, proportion, etc. w/ simple variance/SE calculations
     - Downsides:
       - May not be possible if population cannot be enumerated
       - May be expensive (possible to significantly reduce costs w/ a clustered or stratified design)
   - Sample size estimation
     - Margin of error
     
 - Preview of next week: Sampling Techniques
   - Estimates and variances
   - Stratified sampling
   - Cluster sampling
   - Design effects
