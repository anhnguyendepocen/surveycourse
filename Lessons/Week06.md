# Survey Mode #

## Outline ##

  - Activity
    - 2-3 minute presentation of your project
    - Give feedback to each other
    - What constructs are you trying to measure? How do you propose to do it?
    - What's the status of your questionnaire?
    - What do you need help with?

  - Mode
    - Definition: How the survey responses are collected
    - Recruitment mode and interview mode might differ
    - Not necessarily related to sampling frame
      - E.g., telephone sampling frame might be used to schedule in-person interviews
      - E.g., postal invitation might offer multiple modes
    
  - Modes
    - Personal interviewing
      - "Show cards"
      - Physical data collection (e.g., saliva swabs, blood)
      - Environmental measurement (e.g., water quality, radon levels)
    - Computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI)
    - Self-interviewing/Self-administered
    - Computer-assisted self-interviewing (CASI)
      - Web-based self-interviewing
    - Telephone interviewing
      - Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
      - Telephone-Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interviewing (T-ACASI)
    - New modes
      - Avatars
      - Web-based IVR
      - Mobile
      - SMS
    - Mixed modes
      - Multi-stage interview
      - Nonresponse follow-ups in different mode
      - Sensitive questions
      - Open-ended questions
      - Challenging topics
      - Paradata
      - Journals/logs
  
  - Mode consequences
    - Data quality
      - Recency/primacy
      - Unit and item nonresponse
      - Biases
      - Satisficing
    - Mode preferences
      - Individuals differ in how they want to complete surveys
      - This introduces systematic variability into responses
        - E.g., if those preferring internet differ from those preferring telephone
        - Mode-induced biases might be tied to self-selection into modes
      - Does allowing choice improve reduce survey errors?
    
  
  - Interviewers and modes
    - What do interviewers add to a survey?
      - Data quality
      - Response rates
      - Comfort
    - What consequences do they have?
      - Data quality
      - Discomfort/sensitivity
      - Cost money
      - Require training
      - Must be physically present
  
  - Cost/benefit calculations
    - Three types of costs
      - Fixed
      - Variables
      - Incidental
    - Fixed costs
      - Obtaining a sampling frame
      - Developing sampling plan
      - Salaries for project leaders
      - Interviewer training
      - Computers, handheld devices, vehicles, telephones
      - Programming and questionnaire preparation
      - Pilot testing or pretesting
      - Data cleaning and analysis (software, salaries, etc.)
    - Variable costs
      - Per-contact costs (accounts for nonresponse or refusal)
        - Email contacts
        - Postal/mail contacts
        - Telephone contacts
        - Face-to-face contacts
      - Per-interview costs
        - Interviewer salaries
        - Materials (questionnaires, pencils, etc.)
        - Travel
        - Respondent incentives
    - Incidental costs (contingencies)
      - Note: may not actually spend this money
      - Weather
      - Technology failure
      - Accidental data losses
      - Etc.
    - What determines variable costs?
      - Sample size
      - Response and refusal rates
        - Number of attempts to obtain a completed interview
      - Cost of interviewer time
  
  - Activity: Survey costs
    - Estimate the costs of implementing your survey design
    - What are the fixed costs?
    - What are the variable costs?
    - What are the incidental costs?
    - How much does this mean you need to budget for your survey?
    - If you implemented something differently, how could you increase or decrease costs? 

  - Preview of next week
    - Final week of questionnaire design
      - Organizing questionnaire/interview effectively
      - Collecting supplemental data
    - Assignment
      - Discuss mode alternatives
      - Discuss their impact on cost and data quality
