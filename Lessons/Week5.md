# Questionnaire Design II #

## Outline ##

  - Validity
    - Construct validity
    - Validation studies
      - We can validate some kinds of behaviors
      - Registry-based validation
      - Vote validation (U.S.)
      - Media behavior studies
    - Paradata and collecting supplemental data
  
  - Recall questions
    - Knowledge
    - Behavior
    - DK probes?
  
  - Factors affecting memory
    - Question misunderstanding
      - "Excessive complexity" (Groves et al.)
      - Vague concepts
      - Confusing wording
    - Motivated misreporting
    - Forgetting
    - True "don't know"
    - Ambiguity of reference periods
      - "Telescoping" (Burton and Blair): misattributing events to particular periods
    - Reporting on behalf of others
  
  - Ways of measuring behaviors
    - Listing specific events
    - Providing counts of events
    - Follow-ups about specific events    
  
  - Social desirability
    - In recall questions
    - In evaluative questions
  
  - Group brainstorm: Types of sensitive questions
    - Moral activities (e.g., sex, health topics, etc.)
    - Illegal activity (e.g., drugs, crimes, etc.)
    - Attitudes toward particular groups
    - Personal relationships
    - Money (e.g., income or spending)
    - Religion
    - 
    
  
  - Sensitive questions
    - In recall questions
    - In evaluative questions
  - Activity: Sensitive questions from the respondent perspective
    - Pair activity
      - Read questions to one another, record your reactions to the question
    - Individual activity
      - Complete a sensitive questionnaire and record your reactions
  
  - Addressing sensitivity with question context
  
  - Addressing sensitivity with question wording
    - Activity: Item Count Technique or List Experiment
      - Practice writing a list experiment
      - Brainstorm other ideas that we could use to solicit sensitive responses
  
  - Addressing recall and sensitivity with modes
    - Modes might be hugely influential
    - Tourangeau and Smith give us a glimpse of this
    - We'll talk more about mode next week
  
  
  - Preview of next week (two weeks from now)
    - No class during Kartofflerferie
    - New topics
      - Focus on survey mode
      - Budget
      - Comparison of modes for recruitment and response
    - Assignment
      - Outline of your complete questionnaire
