# Questionnaire Design II #

## Outline ##

  - Anything to discuss from last time?

  - Validity
    - Construct validity
      - How do we know if answers are "true"?
      - Face validity
      - Multi-item reliability
      - Over-time reliability
      - Predictive validity
      - Match survey marginals to prior or population estimates
      
    - Validation studies
      - We can validate some kinds of behaviors
      - Registry-based validation
      - Vote validation (U.S.)
      - Media behavior studies
    - Designated reporter on behalf of whole unit
      - Common in household and organizational studies
    - Paradata and collecting supplemental data
  
  - Recall questions
    - Knowledge
    - Behavior
    - Events
    
    
  - DK probes?
  
  - Ways of measuring behaviors
    - Providing counts of behaviors
    - Providing rates of behaviors
    - Listing specific behavioral events
      - Follow-ups about specific events
  
  - Factors affecting recall-type questions
    - Question misunderstanding
      - "Excessive complexity" (Groves et al.)
      - Vague concepts
      - Confusing wording
    - Motivated misreporting
    - Forgetting
    - True "don't know"
    - Ambiguity of reference periods
      - "Telescoping" (Burton and Blair): misattributing events to particular periods
    - Reporting on behalf of others
  
  - Motivated misreporting
    - Examples
      - Voting more than you actually do
      - Reporting less TV use and more exercise than reality
      - Supporting something you oppose
      - Expressing a neutral rather than negative attitude
    - Social desirability
      - In recall questions
      - In evaluative questions
  
  - Sensitive questions
    - In recall questions
    - In evaluative questions
    - Group brainstorm: Sensitive Topics
      - Moral activities (e.g., sex, health topics, etc.)
      - Illegal activity (e.g., drugs, crimes, etc.)
      - Attitudes toward particular groups
      - Personal relationships
      - Money (e.g., income or spending)
      - Religion
    - Sensitivity might also be influenced by other things
      - Race/gender/etc. of interviewer
      - Survey mode
      - Broader context or survey context
      - Concerns about respondent privacy
    - What consequences do sensitive questions have?
      - Item nonresponse
      - Unit nonresponse
      - Dropoff
      - Misreporting
      - Suspicion
      - Others?
   
  - Activity: Sensitive questions from the respondent perspective
    - Example with a volunteer:
      - Have you ever in your life had a period of time lasting several days or longer when most of the day you felt sad, empty or depressed?
      - Would you say you are for or against allowing child pornography because it's a from of free speech?
    - Pair activity
      - Read questions to one another, record your reactions to the question
    - Individual activity
      - Complete a sensitive questionnaire and record your reactions
  
  - Discussion
    - What reactions did you have to sensitive questions?
    - Is it okay to ask sensitive questions? Is it ethical?
    - Do we need to forewarn people that a study might be sensitive?
  
  - Addressing sensitivity
    - How do we address sensitivity with question context?
    - Brainstorm principles for how to write/word sensitive questions
    - Addressing sensitivity with question wording
      - Activity: Item Count Technique or List Experiment
        - Practice writing a list experiment
    - Addressing recall and sensitivity with modes
      - Modes might be hugely influential
      - Tourangeau and Smith give us a glimpse of this
      - We'll talk more about mode next week
  
  - Preview of next week (two weeks from now)
    - No class during Kartofflerferie
    - New topics
      - Focus on survey mode
      - Budget
      - Comparison of modes for recruitment and response
    - Assignment
      - For this week: Start to have an idea of core constructs
      - For next week: Outline of your complete questionnaire
      - Discuss in groups with the remaining time
