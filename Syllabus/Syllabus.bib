	research. We analysed 1607 studies published in the years 2000 and
	2005 in 17 refereed academic journals, and we identi?ed 490 different
	studies that utilized surveys. We examined the response rates in
	these studies, which covered more than 100,000 organizations and
	400,000 individual respondents. The average response rate for studies
	that utilized data collected from individuals was 52.7 percent with
	a standard deviation of 20.4, while the average response rate for
	studies tha t utilized data collected from organizations was35.7
	percent with a standard deviation of 18.8. Key insights from further
	analysis include relative stability in response rates in the past
	decade and higher response rates for journals published in the USA.
	The use of incentives was not found to be related to response rates
	and, for studies of organizations, the use of reminders was associated
	with lower response rates. Also, electronic data collection efforts
	(e.g. email, phone, web) resulted in response rates as high as or
	higher than traditional mail methodology. We discuss a number of
	implications and recommendations.},

	in Iraq for the period March, 2003–September, 2004, attributed to
	the invasion of Iraq. Our aim was to update this estimate.Methods
	Between May and July, 2006, we did a national cross-sectional cluster
	sample survey of mortality in Iraq. 50 clusters were randomly selected
	from 16 Governorates, with every cluster consisting of 40 households.
	Information on deaths from these households was gathered. Findings
	Three misattributed clusters were excluded from the ? nal analysis;
	data from 1849 households that contained 12 801 individuals in 47
	clusters was gathered. 1474 births and 629 deaths were reported during
	the observation period. Pre-invasion mortality rates were 5·5 per
	1000 people per year (95% CI 4·3–7·1), compared with 13·3 per 1000
	people per year (10·9–16·1) in the 40 months post-invasion. We estimate
	that as of July, 2006, there have been 654 965 (392 979–942 636)
	excess Iraqi deaths as a consequence of the war, which corresponds
	to 2·5% of the population in the study area. Of post-invasion deaths,
	601 027 (426 369–793 663) were due to violence, the most common cause
	being gun?re. Interpretation The number of people dying in Iraq has
	continued to escalate. The proportion of deaths ascribed to coalition
	forces has diminished in 2006, although the actual numbers have increased
	every year. Gun? re remains the most common cause of death, although
	deaths from car bombing have increased.},

	say whatever it takes to make sure that questions are interpreted
	uniformly and as intended. Respondents from a national sample were
	interviewed twice. Each time they were asked the same factual questions
	from ongoing government surveys, five about housing and five about
	recent purchases. The first interview was strictly standardized;
	the second was standardized for half the respondents and conversational
	for the others. Respondents in a second conversational interview
	answered differently than in the first interview more often, and
	for reasons that conformed more closely to official definitions,
	than respondents in a second standardized interview. This suggests
	that conversational interviewing improved comprehension, although
	it also lengthened interviews. We conclude that respondents in a
	national sample may misinterpret certain questions frequently enough
	to compromise data quality and that such misunderstandings cannot
	easily be eliminated by pretesting and rewording questions alone.
	More standardized comprehension may require less standardized interviewer

	representative public health survey based on linkage of information
	in the repeated Danish Health Interview surveys, 1986–2005, to the
	national Danish registers on health and welfare. It facilitates studies
	of self-reported health behaviour and utilisation of healthcare services
	by subgroups and analysis of non-response bias. Research topics:
	DANCOS data are utilised in a variety of analyses presented here
	by a few examples that emphasise the impact of modifiable risk factors
	on public health, description of non-response bias, and the epidemiology
	of chronic pain and of osteoarthritis. Examples of DANCOS-based results
	are shown for each of the four topics. Smoking results in 24% of
	all deaths and, compared to other risk factors for public health,
	smoking accounts for the highest number of years of life lost. For
	non-response the mortality is higher among non-respondents than among
	respondents, but no significant bias on healthcare estimates can
	be seen. On average individuals with chronic pain had 12.8 contacts
	per year to the primary healthcare sector compared with 7.3 for individuals
	without. For osteoarthritis it is estimated that in 2020 there will
	be 22,600 incident cases. Conclusion: DANCOS is a public health survey
	linked with registers with many research possibilities. With this
	article we hope to stimulate further interest in the survey.},

	the mode of invitation has on participation in a web survey. To assess
	the effects of invitation mode on response rates, costs, and demographic

	assigned to experimental groups and sent a mailed invitation letter
	and a $2 cash incentive; a mailed invitation letter only; or an e-mailed
	invitation. Nonresponding faculty received up to two reminders to
	participate, by e-mail. Results indicated that the response rates
	were higher for the groups invited using a postal letter, but the
	inclusion of $2 did not significantly increase the response rates.
	Consistent with expectations, while costs were higher for the mailed
	invitation groups, the mailed invitations improved the demographic
	representativeness of the respondents, especially for the $2 incentive
	group. This study builds on a small body of literature that explicitly
	examines the mode of invitation on survey participation in web surveys

	Researchers have developed at least 14 within-household respondent

	Quasi-probability and nonprobability techniques have been devised
	to increase cooperation and decrease costs, although they sacrifice

	the results of 16 studies that have compared within-household respondent
	selection procedures, with respect to demographic representativeness,
	cooperation or response rates, and costs. Although there is an increasing
	need to hold down costs yet maintain quality and accuracy as response
	rates are falling, little systematic, accessible evidence exists
	to guide choice of respondent selection method.},

	on determining whether incentives are unethical considers them as
	a form of undue influence or coercive offer. We understand the ethical
	issue of undue influence as an issue, not of coercion, but of corruption
	of judgment. By doing so we find that, for the most part, the use
	of incentives to recruit and retain research subjects is innocuous.
	But there are some instances where it is not. Specifically, incentives
	become problematic when conjoined with the following factors, singly
	or in combination with one another: where the subject is in a dependency
	relationship with the researcher, where the risks are particularly
	high, where the research is degrading, where the participant will
	only consent if the incentive is relatively large because the participant's
	aversion to the study is strong, and where the aversion is a principled
	one. The factors we have identified and the kinds of judgments they
	require differ substantially from those considered crucial in most
	previous discussions of the ethics of employing incentives in research
	with human subjects.},

  abstract = {A population is "hidden " when no sampling frame exists and public
	acknowledgment of membership in the population is potentially threatening.
	Accessing such populations is difficult because standard probability
	sampling methods produce low response rates and responses that lack
	candor. Existing procedures for sampling these populations, including
	snowball and other chain-referral samples, the key-informant approach,
	and targeted sampling, introduce well-documented biases into their
	samples. This paper introduces a new variant of chain-referral sampling,
	respondent-driven sampling, that employs a dual system of structured
	incentives to overcome some of the deficiencies of such samples.
	A theoretic analysis, drawing on both Markov-chain theory and the
	theory of biased networks, shows that this procedure can reduce the
	biases generally associated with chain-referral methods. The analysis
	includes a proof showing that even though sampling begins with an
	arbitrarily chosen set of initial subjects, as do most chain-referral
	samples, the composition of the ultimate sample is wholly independent
	of those initial subjects. The analysis also includes a theoretic
	specification of the conditions under which the procedure yields
	unbiased samples. Empirical results, based on surveys of 277 active
	drug injectors in Connecticut, support these conclusions. Finally,
	the conclusion discusses how respondent-driven sampling can improve
	both network sampling and ethnographic 44investigation.},

  abstract = {Introduction: This article reviews research results obtained using
	the Danish Longitudinal Survey of Children born in 1995 (DALSC),
	which is placed at SFI, the Danish National Centre for Social Research.
	DALSC aims to gain insight into children’s growing-up conditions
	in contemporary society. DALSC consists of three subsamples: (1)
	children of Danish mothers; (2) children of ethnic minority mothers;
	and (3) children in out-of-home care. Four waves of data collections
	have been carried out since 1996. Being designed with the purpose
	of obtaining rich and detailed information about children’s development
	and family life, register data was not connected to DALSC before
	2006. Research topics: By using three categories of children as examples
	(ethnic minority children, vulnerable children, and children in out-of-home
	care), the article shows how register data gradually has gained ground
	in research upon children’s health conditions.
	
	Conclusion: We expect to see a more extensive use of administrative
	registers as basis for the analyses in future research.},

	with six dimensions: attraction to public policy making, commitment
	to the public interest, civic duty, social justice, self-sacrifice,

	to create the PSM scale. The measurement theory for the scale is

	surveys of U.S. residents conducted in 2003 and 2008. Adding a visual

	a small but significant increase in correct answers. Treatment effects
	are larger for a subset of the population: women, older people, the
	less educated, and people with a visual cognitive style all perform
	disproportionately better on visual knowledge questions. Validation
	shows that visual knowledge is as indicative of civic competence
	as verbal knowledge. Hence, traditional verbal-only questions miss
	a significant amount of political knowledge. Several population segments
	previously deemed ill-informed in fact store some political information

	more options and take longer to answer in the forced-choice format

	question format encourages deeper processing of response options
	and, as such, is preferable to the check-all format, which may encourage
	a weak satisficing response strategy. Additional analyses show that

	evaluate the extent to which biases introduced during the tracking
	phase can be minimized by using the multivariate chi-square automatic
	interaction detection (CHAID) technique to calculate tracking loss
	adjustments. Unlike a 1995 study that found that these adjustments
	reduced statistical biases among its sample of located females, our
