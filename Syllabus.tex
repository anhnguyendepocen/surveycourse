%\section{Introduction}

Almost every organization --- public or private --- conducts surveys to understand their customers, clients, constituents, research subjects, and the public at-large. Surveys are therefore a critically important methodological tool for conducting empirical political science research and for evaluating policy, performance, and impact. Nearly every political science student will, in the course of their future career, have to conduct, analyze, or interpret survey-based research.

How do we conduct surveys well so that they provide meaningful insights? How do we write survey questions so that respondents understand them and that those responses generate useful data about relevant constructs? How do we decide whom to interview and how do we interview them effectively? How do we prepare for and manage the implementation of a large survey? How do we analyze the obtained results? This course will provide answers to these questions while training students how to implement a survey data collection and analyze the results thereof. The exam will entail the design, preparation, and pilot testing of a survey on the topic of student's choice.

\section{Objectives}
The learning objectives for the course are as follows. By the end of the course, students should be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify and analyze the usefulness of survey methods for conducting research and evaluating programs, policies, and outcomes
\item Identify sources of error and bias in surveys
\item Explain how sampling procedures enable estimation of population parameters and evaluate the implications of differences in sampling techniques
\item Demonstrate how to successfully manage large survey data collection efforts
\item Evaluate the quality of surveys in terms of sampling, interviewing procedures, and questionnaire content 
\item Apply methodological and substantive knowledge from the course to the design and implementation of an original survey
\end{enumerate}

\section{Exam}
The exam for the course involves a home assignment, totaling 8000 words. The exam will take the form of an essay that describes a research question, hypotheses, sampling design, operationalization of constructions, implementation plan, and pilot testing of a proposed survey. A complete questionnaire for that survey, including exact question wordings of all core constructs, must be created and included as a supplemental appendix to the exam paper.

While officially due at the end of the course, each requisite portion of the exam will complete during the course in the form of weekly written assignments that progressively evaluate student learning. As such, the exam is a ``portfolio'' of these earlier assignments, which simply needs to be made into a single, coherent, finished product reflecting peer and instructor feedback from earlier. Details on the weekly assignments are listed in the course schedule. Assignments are due on the day they are described in the schedule.

\section{Reading Material}
The assigned material for the course includes a textbook and empirical research articles, all of which are available online. All readings should be completed for the day they are described. \textbf{There is reading assigned on the first day.} The textbook for the course is:\\

Find a survey online. This can be any survey (a national election study, a political poll, a survey of childhood health, a survey of political interest organizations, a survey of businesses, etc.). Write one page describing the survey project's research objective, the population of cases being surveyed, any important details about how the survey is designed or implemented, and the constructs measured in the survey. Briefly evaluate why the survey is interesting or important. Be prepared to share a summary if this essay in class.
