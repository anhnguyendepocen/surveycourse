	Welfare in the Face of Deservingness Cues},

  abstract = {A robust finding in the welfare state literature is that public support
	for the welfare state differs widely across countries. Yet recent
	research on the psychology of welfare support suggests that people
	everywhere form welfare opinions using psychological predispositions
	designed to regulate interpersonal help giving using cues regarding
	recipient effort. We argue that this implies that cross-national
	differences in welfare support emerge from mutable differences in
	stereotypes about recipient efforts rather than deep differences
	in psychological predispositions. Using free-association tasks and
	experiments embedded in large-scale, nationally representative surveys
	collected in the United States and Denmark, we test this argument
	by investigating the stability of opinion differences when faced
	with the presence and absence of cues about the deservingness of
	specific welfare recipients. Despite decades of exposure to different
	cultures and welfare institutions, two sentences of information can
	make welfare support across the U.S. and Scandinavian samples substantially
	and statistically indistinguishable.},

  title = {Customizing Strategy: Policy Goals and Interest Group Strategies},
  journal = {Interest Groups \& Advocacy},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {115--138},
  number = {1},
  month = mar,
  abstract = {Interest groups pursue a wide range of policy goals. In their attempts
	to realize these goals, groups may lobby bureaucrats and politicians,
	approach the media and engage in protest activities. This article
	investigates the relation between the characteristics of policy goals
	and the strategies of influence utilized by interest groups. Policy
	goals are captured by four dimensions emphasizing: (i) the divisibility
	of goals, (ii) the degree of change sought, (iii) the type of interests
	pursued, and (iv) how technical goals are. The relevance of these
	dimensions and the effect of goals on influence strategies are tested
	in a survey of national Danish interest groups. The findings support
	the importance of group goals as determining strategy. Groups pursuing
	general interests mainly lobby parliament and the media, whereas
	groups with technically complicated goals lobby bureaucrats more
	intensively. The more divisible a goal a group is pursuing, the more
	actively it engages in all types of influence strategies.},

  abstract = {The 1969 Vietnam draft lottery assigned numbers to birth dates in
	order to determine which young men would be called to fight in Vietnam.
	We exploit this natural experiment to examine how draft vulnerability
	influenced political attitudes. Data are from the Political Socialization
	Panel Study, which surveyed high school seniors from the class of
	1965 before and after the national draft lottery was instituted.
	Males holding low lottery numbers became more antiwar, more liberal,
	and more Democratic in their voting compared to those whose high
	numbers protected them from the draft. They were also more likely
	than those with safe numbers to abandon the party identification
	that they had held as teenagers. Trace effects are found in reinterviews
	from the 1990s.Draft number effects exceed those for preadult party
	identification and are not mediated by military service. The results
	show how profoundly political attitudes can be transformed when public
	policies directly affect citizens' lives.},

	Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiments},
  journal = {Journal of Policy Analysis and Management},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {32},
  pages = {60--82},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {In accordance with social exchange theory, prominent streams of management
	research emphasize the importance of reciprocal exchange relationships
	between organizations and their employees. When employees perceive
	themselves as supported by the organization, they reciprocate with
	increased work motivation. However, we do not know how this knowledge
	can be developed into management initiatives that increase public
	employees’ perceived support, because severe endogeneity problems
	make it difficult to estimate the effect of organizational support
	on employee commitment outside the laboratory. We use a randomized
	field experiment involving more than 800 public employees to estimate
	the effect. We find no average effect of the organizational support
	treatment on the employees’ perceived organizational support. Yet,
	a subgroup analysis shows a positive treatment effect when the employees’
	local front-line managers felt less supported prior to the intervention.
	We discuss the implications for theory and management practice.},

	Efficacy from Large-Scale Municipal Reform},
  journal = {American Political Science Review},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {105},
  pages = {238--258},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Optimal jurisdiction size is a cornerstone of government design. A
	strong tradition in political thought argues that democracy thrives
	in smaller jurisdictions, but existing studies of the effects of
	jurisdiction size, mostly cross-sectional in nature, yield ambiguous
	results due to sorting effects and problems of endogeneity. We focus
	on internal political efficacy, a psychological condition that many
	see as necessary for high-quality participatory democracy. We identify
	a quasiexperiment, a large-scale municipal reform in Denmark, which
	allows us to estimate a causal effect of jurisdiction size on internal
	political efficacy. The reform, affecting some municipalities, but
	not all, was implemented by the central government, and resulted
	in exogenous, and substantial, changes in municipal population size.
	Based on survey data collected before and after the reform, we find,
	using various difference-in-difference and matching estimators, that
	jurisdiction size has a causal and sizeable detrimental effect on
	citizens' internal political efficacy.},

  abstract = {How are civilian attitudes toward combatants affected by wartime victimization?
	Are these effects conditional on which combatant inflicted the harm?We
	investigate the determinants of wartime civilian attitudes towards
	combatants using a survey experiment across 204 villages in five
	Pashtun-dominated provinces of Afghanistan—the heart of the Taliban
	insurgency. We use endorsement experiments to indirectly elicit truthful
	answers to sensitive questions about support for different combatants.
	We demonstrate that civilian attitudes are asymmetric in nature.
	Harm inflicted by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)
	is met with reduced support for ISAF and increased support for the
	Taliban, but Taliban-inflicted harm does not translate into greater
	ISAF support. We combine a multistage sampling design with hierarchical
	modeling to estimate ISAF and Taliban support at the individual,
	village, and district levels, permitting a more fine-grained analysis
	of wartime attitudes than previously possible.},
